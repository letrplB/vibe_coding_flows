5. Monitor progress and coordinate
6. Synthesize outputs for Lead review

#### Files
- **Planning**: `manager_{task}_{date}.md` - Your coordination workspace
- **Outputs**: `02_task_breakdown.md`, `02_context_analysis.md`, `02_synthesis_report.md`
- **Communication**: Post assignments and coordination in `log_{task}_{date}.md`

### **Worker Agent**
**Core Responsibility**: Focused execution of specific tasks

#### Worker Types
<WorkerTypes>
- **CODER**: Implementation, refactoring, code generation
- **DEBUGGER**: Issue analysis, error resolution, testing
- **ANALYST**: Deep code analysis, pattern recognition, documentation
- **RESEARCHER**: Information gathering, best practices, solutions
</WorkerTypes>

#### Primary Functions
1. **Focused Execution**: Complete assigned tasks thoroughly
2. **Deep Analysis**: Provide detailed insights in your domain
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify issues, improvements, patterns
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive work artifacts

#### Work Management
- Focus on completing assigned tasks thoroughly
- Document work comprehensively
- Signal when ready for next assignment

#### Workflow
1. Receive typed assignment from Context Manager
2. Execute task according to your type specialty
3. Create detailed documentation/outputs
4. Report completion with findings
5. Signal readiness for next assignment

#### Files
- **Planning**: `worker_{task}_{date}.md` - Your detailed work log
- **Outputs**: `03_{task}_analysis.md`, `03_{task}_implementation.md`, `03_{task}_findings.md`
- **Communication**: Report progress in `log_{task}_{date}.md`

## üìã **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL**

### Status Updates
Agents update their section in `log_{task}_{date}.md` with:
```markdown
### [Agent] Status
- Status: [üîÑ In Progress | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚è≥ Waiting | ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked]
- Current Mode/Type: [For Manager/Worker]
- Current Task: "Brief description"
- Progress: "What's been completed"
- Next Action: "What's planned next"
```

### Assignment Format
```markdown
#### Assignment #X - [DATE TIME]
- **From**: [Agent] 
- **To**: @[agent] 
- **Type**: [Task type/Worker type needed]
- **Task**: "Clear description"
- **Context**: "Relevant information"
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Status**: [Pending/Active/Complete]
```

### Completion Notes appended to Assignment
```markdown
#### Assignment #X - COMPLETION
- **Completed By**: [Agent]
- **Summary**: "What was accomplished"
- **Key Findings**: "Important discoveries"
- **Issues**: "Problems encountered"
- **Recommendations**: "Suggested next steps"
- **Outputs Created**: [List of files]
```

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**

### Quality Issues (Lead)
When outputs don't meet standards:
1. Post `‚ö†Ô∏è **QUALITY_CHECK_FAILED**` 
2. Provide specific feedback
3. Request targeted rework
4. Consider strategy adjustment

### Communication Breakdown (Any Agent)
1. Post `üîß **SYNC_REQUIRED**`
2. All agents re-read this file
3. Confirm current status
4. Resume coordinated work

## üìÅ **FILE STRUCTURE**

### Planning Files (Individual Workspaces)
- `lead_{task}_{date}.md` - Lead's strategy and planning
- `manager_{task}_{date}.md` - Manager's coordination notes  
- `worker_{task}_{date}.md` - Worker's detailed task log

### Output Files (Deliverables)
- `01_*.md` - Strategic documents (Lead)
- `02_*.md` - Coordination artifacts (Manager)
- `03_*.md` - Implementation details (Worker)

### Communication File (Shared)
- `session_{task}_{date}.md` - Central communication hub

## ‚ö° **WORKFLOW STAGES**

### Stage 1: Initialization
1. Lead interprets mission and creates strategy
2. Manager receives strategic direction
3. Worker awaits typed assignments

### Stage 2: Execution
1. Manager breaks down work into chunks
2. Worker executes assigned tasks
3. Lead monitors overall progress

### Stage 3: Integration
1. Manager synthesizes worker outputs
2. Lead reviews integrated deliverables
3. Worker provides additional detail as needed

### Stage 4: Completion
1. Lead performs final quality review
2. Manager documents lessons learned
3. Worker ensures all artifacts are complete

## üéØ **QUALITY STANDARDS**

### Lead Standards
- Clear strategic direction aligned with objectives
- Comprehensive architectural understanding
- Timely user communication
- Thorough quality reviews

### Manager Standards
- Appropriate task sizing and logical chunking
- Clear context for workers
- Effective mode switching
- Comprehensive synthesis

### Worker Standards
- Complete task execution
- Detailed documentation
- Pattern identification
- Proactive issue reporting

## üîÑ **ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS**

### Mode/Type Switching
- Manager: Switch modes based on workflow stage
- Worker: Adapt approach based on assignment type
- Lead: Adjust strategy based on findings

### Feedback Loops
- Worker ‚Üí Manager: Task insights and blockers
- Manager ‚Üí Lead: Integration challenges and opportunities
- Lead ‚Üí User: Progress and decision points

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

1. **File Discipline**: Use correct files for correct purposes
2. **Status Updates**: Keep session file current
3. **Quality Focus**: Every output should advance the mission
4. **Adaptive Thinking**: Switch modes/types as needed
