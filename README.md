# Vibe Coding Workflows

A collection of advanced AI-powered workflow systems designed to orchestrate complex development tasks through structured agent collaboration and intelligent automation.

## Workflows

### CLAUDE_workflow
A production-ready three-agent workflow system that orchestrates specialized AI agents (Lead, Manager, Worker) to accomplish complex tasks through structured collaboration. Features include:

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Lead (strategic oversight), Manager (adaptive coordination), Worker (specialized execution)
- **Structured Communication**: Assignment tracking, progress milestones, decision logging, quality gates
- **Individual Workspaces**: Private canvases for each agent's planning and execution
- **Flexible Specialization**: Multiple agent types and modes for different task requirements
- **Quality Focus**: Multiple review gates, clear success criteria, comprehensive documentation

Perfect for complex multi-step projects, large codebase analysis, feature implementation, system refactoring, and documentation generation.

## Getting Started

Each workflow folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new workflows or improve existing ones. Each workflow should:
- Have clear documentation in its README
- Include setup and usage instructions
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Be self-contained within its folder
