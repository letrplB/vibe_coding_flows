## Workflows

### CLAUDE_workflow
A sophisticated three-agent workflow system (Lead, Manager, Worker) that orchestrates complex development tasks through structured collaboration. See the [CLAUDE_workflow README](CLAUDE_workflow/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Getting Started

Each workflow folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new workflows or improve existing ones. Each workflow should:
- Have clear documentation in its README
- Include setup and usage instructions
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Be self-contained within its folder
